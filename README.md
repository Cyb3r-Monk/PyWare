# PyWare

## Server-less Ransomware PoC written in Python

This project started out as an AES and RSA encryption toolkit (See AES-CLI repository)

which quickly sparked my interest in ransomware and key encryption and management.

I wanted to try my hand at a pythonic ransomware proof-of-concept and wanted to see

if I could make it server less. Hope you enjoy


STILL IN DEV!
